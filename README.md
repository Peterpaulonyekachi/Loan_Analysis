### Loan Collection Analysis: Impact of Call Responses on Loan Recovery
# Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between call center engagement and loan recovery rates. It aims to determine how answered calls influence repayment while identifying the impact of unanswered calls (busy, congested, no answer, answer machine) on outstanding debts.

# Objectives
- To assess the effectiveness of call engagement in loan recovery.
- To analyze borrower demographics (state, occupation) in relation to call responses.
- To identify trends and patterns that can optimize loan recovery strategies.
# Data Sources
-Call Logs Dataset (dbo.analysis_fairmoney)
- Contains details of borrower calls categorized into answered and unanswered calls.
- Borrower Information Dataset (fairmoney_details)
- Includes borrower demographics such as state, occupation, and loan details (amount disbursed, repaid, and outstanding).
# Key Analyses Conducted
  # State-Wise Loan Call Analysis
    - Evaluated answered and unanswered call distribution across states.
    - Identified states with the highest and lowest response rates.
  # Occupation-Based Loan Call Analysis
    - Assessed how different occupational groups responded to loan recovery calls.
    - Highlighted occupations with the highest loan repayment risks due to low call engagement.
  # Overall Impact on Loan Recovery
    - Measured how distinct answered calls correlated with increased loan repayment.
    - Compare the impact of unanswered calls on outstanding debts.
# Findings & Insights
A significant portion of loan borrowers did not answer recovery calls, impacting collection rates.
Certain states had a higher proportion of unanswered calls, leading to increased loan default risks.
Borrowers in specific occupations (e.g., Professionals, Artisans, and Agriculture workers) had lower engagement rates, requiring alternative follow-up strategies.
# Recommendations
Implement targeted follow-up actions for high-risk states and occupations.
Introduce automated reminders and alternative communication channels for unreachable borrowers.
Optimize call center operations to improve answer rates and enhance loan recovery.
